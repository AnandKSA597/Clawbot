# ü§ñ Clawbot

Clawbot is a robotic claw system designed to pick and place small objects using a programmable robotic arm. The project focuses on motion control, gripping mechanics, and precise actuation for real-world automation tasks. Ideal for learning robotics, embedded systems, and control algorithms.


## üõ†Ô∏è Features

- Motor-driven base and arm movement
- Servo-controlled claw grip
- Manual and automatic control modes
- Obstacle detection and limit-switch safety
- Modular code structure for easy updates

## üß∞ Tech Stack

- **Hardware:** Arduino Uno / ESP32, Servo Motors, DC Motors (Johnson), L298N Motor Driver, Limit Switches, Power Supply
- **Software:** Arduino IDE / PlatformIO
- **Libraries Used:** 
  - `Servo.h` (for claw control)
  - `AFMotor.h` / `AccelStepper` (for movement)
  - Custom motor control functions
